# SCAD-Elite

This is a library of OpenSCAD conversion of the models from the original 1984 Elite.

Coordinates extracted from the outstanding bbcelite.com BBC Micro Elite disassembly project.

Rebuilt for OpenSCAD by Einar Lielmanis, einars@spicausis.lv.

The dimensions are left intact from the original. You may adjust `width` (or
`r` for circular objects, like thargoid and Coriolis base) for printing, or something.
